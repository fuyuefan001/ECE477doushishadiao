# TicketBot

TicketBot is a robot that identifies parking violations in the parking lot. The robot travels through the parking lot, takes pictures of the parked vehicle, and transfers the captured photos to the server through Wi-Fi; the movement of the robot will be manually controlled. The server will identify the license plate number from the image and search for the corresponding licence plate number in the database. If an invalid license plate is detected, the license plate photo and vehicle location will be sent to parking staff.
